## 2D Perovskites	



### The effect of organic molecule on the Stability of the 2D perovskite 



- The formation energy calculation with and without vdW interactions
- Changes in the charge distribution before and after organic molecule

Considering SOC calculations it can be concluded that there is no significant changes in the stability order after taking SOC into account.
